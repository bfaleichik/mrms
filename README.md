# mrms
**An experimental code implementing the Minimal Residual Multistep methods for the solution of linear ODE systems**

Files:

-  *solvers.py* contains fixed-step MRMS and BDF solvers
  
-  *problems.py* contains initial value problems to test the solvers
 
-  *test_\*.py* scripts perform single run of three solvers on the corresponding problem

-  *benchmark_\*.py* scripts perform benchmarking and build the time-error diagrams
